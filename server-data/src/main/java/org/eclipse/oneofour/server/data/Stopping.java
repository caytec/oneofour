/**
 * A class for tracking shutdown of a service
 * <p>
 * When a service gets called to stop it can return a {@link Stopping} instance
 * which can be used to identify the end of the stopping process. A standard
 * call to a stop method will initiate the shutdown process of this service.
 * However when the stop method returns it is not ensured that all resources are
 * already freed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link Stopping} interface allows to wait for the actual shutdown of all
 * resources while staying outside of service instances and its locks.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link Stopping} interface can be compared to {@link Future} or
 * {@link CompletionStage}, although it is not that sophisticated and more
 * targeted to this specific task.
